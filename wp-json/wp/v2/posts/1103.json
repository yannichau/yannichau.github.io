Afterall, compared to Hong Kong\u2019s transport system, there\u2019s endless things going on in Britain\u2019s mammoth rail network \u2014 the grandeur of its ancient steam trains, the funny discussions regarding its post-war rail network (especially after the Beeching cuts), the never ending projects like Cross Rail (Purple Line\/ Elizabeth Line\/ Tfl Rail) and HS2, the heated debates around timetable reforms and re-nationalisation, and so much more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"808b\">As most of you might be aware of, Hong Kong, now under Chinese rule, was under British sovereignty prior to the 1997 handover. It is therefore no coincidence that many similarities can be drawn between its rail network and Britain\u2019s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"8201\">Alongside many other things in Hong Kong, many parts of its rail network is or will be experiencing a large overhaul. Considering that electrification or the construction of various electrified railways occurred post-war in the 60s or 70s, similar to Britain, this is understandably the time for upgrades.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"4777\">With this in mind, I present you with a brief history of the Hong Kong\u2019s rail network (which could probably be better explained by Wikipedia anyways), and along the way, present a collection of photos I have taken during my trainspotting trips in Hong Kong.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"23b7\">Hopefully you would be able to draw some resemblances to Britain\u2019s trains and network. Otherwise, just enjoy the photographs!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p id=\"8f24\">\ud83d\udd17 Note: I have embedded a number of links throughout the article, which are mostly Wikipedia articles on relevant topics.

Oddly, the DLR commenced in 1987, 1 year prior to Hong Kong\u2019s LRT. Like the DLR, the LRT runs on (decently heavy) 36 tonne vehicles. Unlike the DLR, the LRT has many road crossings, which makes its operational aspects more similar to tramlink. Unlike tramlink, the LRT requires a greater amount of the platform infrastructure due to the non low-floor design. Similar to the both systems, LRT stops are unmmaned, which makes the system prone to issues like vandalism and fare evasion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery alignwide has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-6 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1F-L4F3tWDNhz8sIiTuiSoQ.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1p4425Bf3FwA9AlY4F1S_pw.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"3966\">Of all 3 systems, I like&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tramlink\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tramlink<\/a>&nbsp;the most. It\u2019s vehicles are sleek, and operation-wise it makes sense. It is a cleaner alternative for buses, and the platform infrastructure required is minimal due to the trams\u2019 low-floor design. More importantly it feels right in place for a street setting. That said it is the newest of the bunch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"514b\">The&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Docklands_Light_Railway\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DLR<\/a>&nbsp;is called a light rail but it runs on quite an expensive set of instructure, and at that point we might as well run a conventional heavy rail system with 1\u20132 coaches, with the potential to add more coaches in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"2a01\">Hong Kong\u2019s LRT encounters the same dilema as the DLR, and on top of that, it is considered by many a worse solution than the buses it was meant to replace. Of all 3 systems, I think it is the worst thought-out, as the system occupies quite a bit of road infrastructure, but fails to blend into a street setting gracefully.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ddd0\">A quick comparison on train interiors<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"865b\">Considering that all heavy rail services in Hong Kong are rapid transit style, it\u2019s natural to compare it to London\u2019s underground. For those accustomed to travelling on London\u2019s \u201ctube\u201d, you might be slightly surprised to find that Hong Kong\u2019s trains better resemble something like a TfL rail, overground or LU subsurface (Circle, Metropolitan, District, Hammersmith and City Line) service. The reasons for that are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Hong Kong\u2019s system itself is not as ancient as London\u2019s underground, so the infrastructure is designed to accomodate larger trains with a greater passenger capacity.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Walkthrough gangways between carriages have been here for quite a while and I\u2019m not quite sure why this hasn\u2019t been implemented on the London Underground until the recent S stock.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Air conditioning was implemented since electrification. In contrast, only the S stock has air conditioning, and it looks like a big challenge to implement AC in the deep level tube lines, considering the constraints on ventilation and the outdated electrical mains.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"b67f\">All in all, this contributes to a more spacious, comfortable (but arguably \u201cclinically feeling\u201d) look for Hong Kong\u2019s carriage interiors. Nevertheless this is the trend all train manufacturers are adopting today, for practicality concerns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery alignwide has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-7 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1_hxHRX8tyqTvnHM74EgI-g.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">London Underground S7 Stock Interior<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1xksk0fkXyuMongwqtazbjQ.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">TfL Rail Class 345 Interior<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1aqXoiadQwNk3KImgjZCxVw.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">London Overground Class 700 Interior<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1z8Kz9SAja9gNoWXbk7ySZg.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">London Overground Electrostar 378 Interior<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1sI1hcxQ734wkd5qhQzBjZw.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Hong Kong Ma On Shan Line SP1900 Interior<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1wI8Tkce0Q-IHWZTQO3LSQQ.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Hong Kong East Rail Line R-Stock Interior<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"e35e\">One striking similarity you might see is that R-stock has the same hanging hand-straps as all Class 378 and 700.

The appearance of the hand-straps is subjective, but personally I think they don\u2019t feel ergonomic.
