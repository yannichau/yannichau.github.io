Looks like a pretty nice place to start with, but not necessarily so when you see pigeons doing their business within the station.

I was actually kind of looking forward to seeing the Class 315s running on TfL rail, but I guess they run quite infrequently. This is the interiors of the Class 345 Aventra, exactly the type I previously saw at London Paddington.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1_1xksk0fkXyuMongwqtazbjQ.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Interiors of the TfL Rail Class 345 Aventra<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"c6d8\">Its colourful maquette seat covering is quite a delight to look at as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1_1R3uYZUbVw0vgF6uw81kvYg.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">TfL Rail Maquette seat covering<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"03bf\">As expected, this is a photo of the front of the locomotive when we arrived at Romford.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1APeBhYcWmDHOnGuv9Nuz9Q.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Southbound TfL Rail approaching Romford. (Class 345 Aventra)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"ead5\">I think I was pretty bored at the time, so I even took a few picture of the sleepers of the rail. I later did a bit of reading, and turns out \u201cTarmac\u201d used to be one of the country\u2019s largest suppliers for concrete rail sleepers. On a side note, when I was on my volunteering trip to the Ffestiniog and Welsh Heritage Railway, we were told that the newly replaced sleepers were made from recycled plastics. A lot of work must have went into this kind of product to make sure it wouldn\u2019t expand or contract drastically during extreme weather conditions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"9549\">I don\u2019t know what company supplies sleepers for the national rail network right now, but the recycled plastic sleepers that I talked about are definitely not as widespread at the moment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1ik7vIh9cTDZ-a6KZWvyQCw.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">\u201cTarmac\u201d concrete rail sleepers<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"3904\">Meanwhile, we also spotted a stopping southbound Greater Anglia Railway service. Interestingly, there weren\u2019t any northbound Greater Anglia services that stopped at Romford that day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1FSYdBncCKJ5fChSPsyY4Wg.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Greater Anglia Railway Class 321 trains stopping at Romford.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"66bc\">We were waiting for the London Overground Romford to Upminster service to arrive, and finally here it is! The locomotive is quite \u201cboxy\u201d indeed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"c25e\">Another interesting thing I observed was the train\u2019s double-leaf sliding doors, rather than the single-leaf sliding doors or sliding plug doors used in today\u2019s trains. Not sure what the advantage of a double-leaf sliding door is; maybe it has better aerodynamics, or maybe it reduces the chance of debris jamming on the door rails. But this design is definitely something from the past.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1R7u-vn7dd3heh2MZ0rbBpA.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">London Overground Class 315<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"a6a1\">The exterior of the train looks quite normal, but the interior definitely shows the age of the train, as if it is something from the 60s. It even has luggage racks, which reminds us that it used to run long-haul suburban services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1aJcs9tiAWJH7g9B4KVqiug.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">London Overground Class 315 Interiors<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"bdb5\">Still, the train has been retrofitted with shiny new buttons.

So we hopped on the c2c service to Barking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1L-FgukDF3z4M87TiCVYZdw.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">c2c Class 357<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"394b\">This was the first time I saw 2 locomotives connected in this manner. I later found this to be quite common, but at the time I thought it was pretty interesting. I guess the service was bound to split at some point down the line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1Wam9I_Q3fjnH2HRCxcDfSQ.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"828f\">Interior wise, we could tell that it was an intercity service, with the maximised seating arrangement and luggage racks. The somewhat limey and pink colour scheme did feel like something from Disneyland though.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1grlHUloqg7FCp7DXnr9K4A.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Interiors of c2c Class 357<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"f28e\">At this point, we\u2019ve arrived at Barking, where we decided to halt our first leg of the journey. It was then we realised that we have been charged penalty fares (to be explained at the end of the article). Perhaps we need to do some more keep tracking next time&#8230;&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"da43\">After lunch, we boarded the Barking to Gospel Oak Overground service, which runs the newest Class 710. I believe they had been running on the line since late 2019, and are currently running on the Watford DC Branch as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1cWkQ6Pvm6hAgx2LUWe9bHw.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Overground Class 710\u2019s sleek exterior!<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"9c37\">Interestingly, TfL decided to introduce a new maquette on these train seats to freshen up things a bit. The green does demarcate quite a bit from the traditional orange and brown colour scheme.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1_1IY6bBDyTj6UkzjmE_o9vww.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Brand new maquette seat coverings on the Class 710s.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"6521\">Surprisingly (or not so surprisingly), autumn leaf fall is a real concern for the London Overground. I would imagine Hong Kong\u2019s MTR simply removing trees along the railway regularly just to ensure that this kind of thing wouldn\u2019t happen. Is TfL a tree conservation organisation as well?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1PGeYIuwJINR_CDcQbd12FA.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Leaf Fall Autumn 2019 Notice<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"2430\">After quite a while, we arrived at Harringay Green Lanes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/19gqvC03v5_MXHy8QjMLlcQ.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">A cyclist boarding the overground<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"35da\">A final look at the Class 710s.

Do check out my previous post for a few more shots of the Govia Thameslink Railway Class 700 Desiro City\u2019s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1_1F-L4F3tWDNhz8sIiTuiSoQ.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">East Croydon Tram Station, Westbound.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"b6ed\">This was my first time on trams in the UK, and to be perfectly honest I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been on many trams across the world before. Trams that come to my mind is Hong Kong Island\u2019s Tram and Kagoshima\u2019s Trams. (I think these are the only two tram networks I\u2019ve been on before)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"b82e\">I think the reason we don\u2019t see many tram systems nowadays is the lack of flexibility of a tram system, as well as the somewhat high maintenance cost for the trams and road infrastructure. This is also coupled by the fact that trams indirectly worsen road congestion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"c601\">Unlike the aforementioned tram systems, London\u2019s Tramlink system, built in 2000, is relatively new. I personally don\u2019t buy into the concept of trams, as I just think they aren\u2019t suitable in densely populated places where streets are likely narrow, or in somewhat moderately populated places where housing developments are far apart. Nonetheless, as a rail enthusiast, I enjoy being on trams, and I am delighted to see how they develop in the near future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/12UEOIK7FiQMkPILKs4D1Hg.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"550e\">Each tram has a super low floor designs of 350 mm high (or 350 mm low, depending on your perspective), which is much lower than Hong Kong\u2019s Trams. As a result, the ceiling is deceptively high as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"cc89\">As always, close ups of seat maquette patterns deserve ta full width position in my blog. (This would be apparent if you read this on a desktop or laptop)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1exrFOPz4N5dETLE0TZemHg.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">London Tramslink seat maquette cover pattern.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"c13d\">Our tram journey came to an end at Mitcham Junction. This portion of tram actually operates actually more like light or medium rail, with segregated right-of-way. However, this is also the section where some parts are single-tracked, so service frequency is limited.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1nX7BQinz2v5DUuFdCfZiaw.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Mitcham Junction Tram Station.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"950d\">Subsequently, we boarded various trains before arriving at Balham. I didnt\u2019 take as many photos as I wanted since we were actually kind of in a rush. Everything before East Croydon commenced as expected, but if you see the schedule outlined at the end of the blog, you can see how things started to get complicated here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1_lRZZHat5vpb5lpfqPrYug.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Southern Class 377 Train approaching Balham.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"968b\">Our train to Clapham Junction was luckily delayed by 5 minutes, which gave us a slight bit more time to run from the underground station to the ground-level platform. I know I should probably feel happy for this, but perhaps that is also the exact reason why Southern was voted the worst train operator for 3 years in a row.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0013\">I was quite captivated by the look of the Class 455 locmotives however.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1OqU982O51Bepoz5hujc_Ag.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Southern Class 455 Train approaching Balham.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"8940\">The aesthetic of the interiors are quite clean, with the curved handrails reaching up to the rail of continuous light boxes. The round yellow handle-pieces on the seats are &#8220;cute&#8221;, and somehow they remind me of Mickey Mouse&#8217;s ears.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1kkUESEpaNi_33lctMpvkKw.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Southern Class 455 Interiors.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"e9e4\">When we arrived at Clapham Junction, we immediately rushed to board the train to Kensington (Olympia).
