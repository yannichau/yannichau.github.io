Therefore, our current consumption model is not sustainable for our future, and there is a need to reduce our consumption or even replenish our resources .<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"51a7\">Since societies in the past century have long prioritised economic development while over-exploiting resources at an unsustainable rate, the focus of sustainability now lies upon using finite resources wisely, with a view of long term consequences\u00b3. This is a controversial topic, as certain resources that we rely on, like fossil fuels, are non- renewable. Yet, these are resources currently required for key industries of our nation, such as automobiles, transport or energy generation; it is also important to point out the importance of these resources in lifting underdeveloped nations out of poverty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"a0d6\">What can you do?<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"36b3\">When abstracted to a personal level, sustainable living is a new lifestyle in which individuals make changes to reduce environmental degradation\u2076.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/0YXlrQF8FaN5GlC4o.png\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0e7f\">All in all, while the aim of achieving an \u201cenvironmental equilibrium\u201d and zero carbon footprint is not strictly achievable, sustainable living is most importantly the spirit of achieving it to its fullest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2d62\">Just to sum things up<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"bad8\">Achieving sustainability is a complex task that requires collaborative efforts from governments and corporations across the world, and most importantly, you. Failure to address these would lead to pollution, resource depletion or other forms of environmental degradation, and further accelerate geopolitical tensions that affect the livelihood of citizens, particularly in underdeveloped nations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"866a\">Here at VoltShare, we are enthusiastic of achieving a more sustainable lifestyle as well. With the increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EV), we have an ambitious mission to build an EV charger network across our network that is powered by the community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"c668\">Join us on our journey to make our world greener, and read on!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p id=\"341f\"><a href=\"https:\/\/voltshare.hubspotpagebuilder.com\/series-1-what-is-sustainability-0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Access the full whitepaper<\/em><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3ffb\">About VoltShare<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"2eac\">This is an article written for VoltShare.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"885c\">VoltShare was established in 2019 with one mission in mind \u2014 to push the UK towards cleaner transport, by overcoming EV range anxiety.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"3b36\">Beyond the environmental benefits of accelerating EV adoption, our community sharing charger network harnesses the power of sharing economy, bringing communities together and boosting their economic opportunities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0316\">Let\u2019s look forward to a more vibrant and greener future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"d729\">Learn more about us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.voltshare.co.uk\/#\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">voltshare.co.uk<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"a4ac\">About the author<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"f85b\">I am Yan To, soon to be a 3rd year EEE student at Imperial College London. I am fascinated with energy systems and the power industry as a whole, and that to a great extent drew me towards VoltShare.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0a5f\">From my end, I particularly admire the company\u2019s ambitious mission in building a decentralised network of EV chargers, built by the community and for the community. This sharing economy approach fundamentally challenges the somewhat top-down approach adopted by other network providers, and appears to be a sustainable approach in accelerating Britain\u2019s footsteps towards electric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"6f64\">I am currently an intern at VoltShare, and this is only the first of an upcoming series of whitepaper articles that aim to reflect VoltShare\u2019s values and aspirations.
