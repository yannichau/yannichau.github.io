This is why I have spent quite a while travelling around in London by trains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"adab\">It is undeniable that Hong Kong has one of the best public transport systems across the globe, with excellent overall quality and reliability; and having been in London for a few months, I definitely can see why people always say Hong Kongers should be thankful for having such a reliable system. It is evident that London\u2019s system is way more unreliable and inefficient than Hong Kong\u2019s, and that passengers don\u2019t get access to fancy things that Hong Kongers take for granted, like air-conditioning or network-wide cellular network. But we often have to remind ourselves that London\u2019s system is, simply put, old. Whatever \u201cold\u201d means to you, \u201coldness\u201d conveys heritage and culture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"618c\">The following is a collection of random photos I have taken of London\u2019s tubes and trains on my camera and phone.
