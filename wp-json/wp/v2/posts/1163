All mini metro games always end a bit too fast and a bit too unexpected, leaving you miserable at times and frustrated in other times. This is how I feel right now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1AGj6NSqmtSPRygq18c8j6A.png\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">2047 passengers? a bit too quick\u2026\u2026.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"bb8a\">That said, I\u2019m glad had all these exciting experiences \u2014 enduring through a stressful but fruitful (half) year of education, participating in activities like robotics and skating, meeting new friends in school and in church, and of course, doing a bit of train-spotting with my new friends from rail society. I wish I did a bit more travelling, but right now I\u2019m just happy to be back in Hong Kong. Maybe later I\u2019ll put together an album of memories for this academic year, maybe not\u2026\u2026\u2026 anyways this article is supposed to be focused on trains!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0209\">Every major train journey I\u2019ve had starts in state of uneasiness. We missed our original train from Shenzhen to Guangzhou due to long ticketing queues and almost missed our train to Tibet during our 2019 graduation trip. For our 2019 Wales and Ffestiniog Trip, we almost missed our train to Birmingham new street, though that was not actually that severe since we could have got on a later train (a much later one) instead. For my most recent trip to Gatwick Airport, I almost messed up for being in the wrong part of the train, since the front 4 coaches were divided at Redhill and headed for somewhere else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"465f\">I guess that\u2019s part of being a train enthusiast, who always makes predictions that are way too optimistic. Imagine the countless number of station announcements whirling in your ears mixed with all the nonsense twirling in your mind. For this January train-spotting trip, things are a slight bit different, in that there\u2019s less frantically chasing trains, and more like trains chasing by us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"ed57\">The motion blur photo below is of an Avanti West Coast Pedolino speeding by Watford Junction, taken at a time when we weren\u2019t quite chasing trains. The chilling gust of wind as the train busts through is quite shivering though.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1c3RBvgY-Cl7Caf7eezUXpg.jpg\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Avanti West Coast Pedolino speeding through Watford Junction.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"d3d0\">During our last trainspotting trip in November, we somehow managed to go beyond the maximum travel time which costed us quite a bit; in fact, we paid nearly double the daily cap price for zones 1 to 4. This time around, with a bit more careful planning, we managed to stay within the cap for zones 1 to 2. We made sure we stayed within the 1 hour 50 min limit (for zones 1 to 2 on weekends). Our planned and actual itenerary are as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"91bb\"><strong>Schedule<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0cb7\">Leg 1: From South Kensington [1] to Canary Wharf [2] (&lt;1hr50m)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>(10:00 Enter South Kensington)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>10:30 Bank Platform 9 DLR<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>11:00 Arrive Canary Wharf, exit station; possible attractions: Crossrail Place<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"f786\">Leg 2: From Canary Wharf [2] to Clapham Junction [2] (&lt;1hr40m)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>11:40 Enter Canary Wharf<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>12:00 Arrive at Lewisham<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>12:09 Lewisham Southeastern Train to Waterlooeast (trains to Charing Cross, at 09, 16, 36, 46 every hour)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>12:25 Arrive Waterlooeast, walk to Waterloo<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>12:40 Arrive at Clapham Junction by London Southwestern (must not exit later than 13:00\/13:20)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"cd26\">Leg 3: From Clapham Junction [2] to Euston [1] (&lt;1hr50m)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>13:40 Southern Train to Watford Junction (train to to Milton Keynes Central)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>14:20 Arrive Watford Junction<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>14:35 West Midland Trains to London Euston<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>14:53 Arrive Euston (must not exit later than 15:10\/15:30)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"a463\">Remaining Legs<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Walk to Reagents Park<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bakerloo Line to Wilesden Junction<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Overground back to Kensington Olympia<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"4124\">In a totally British fashion, most journeys were actually a slight bit delayed, though they did not cause us any major setbacks in terms of delay times and fares.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"7a1d\">Leg 1<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"5af5\">Not many photos were taken during leg 1 since it was mostly travelling in the underground anyways. As expected, we ended our first leg of our journey at Canary Wharf. Interestingly, we managed to catch a DLR train that arrived at the middle platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"3094\">If you look closely at the photo, you can literally see the platform of West India Quay right behind the tip of this train (it looks like so but physically not so). This shows how close the two stations actually are. In fact, I think I have never even seen two bus stops so close to each other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/16Gpzc2x5V6swhuFjwhB15g.jpg\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">DLR B90 Stock<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"53f7\">During this half an hour break, we walked around Canary Wharf, went to take a peek at the future Crossrail station and ended up at Poplar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/14KBetXByNn8vstuGjPel1Q.jpg\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">DLR B07 Stock<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"f0b8\">It looks like a pretty new station, and as you can see the platforms are covered with glass roofs.

The colours still end up a bit weird though.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1_1p4425Bf3FwA9AlY4F1S_pw.jpg\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">DLR train approaching Poplar.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"b16b\">On a side note, new DLR trains are on the horizons, and they will replace the B90\/92\/92K stock pretty soon (soon in a British sense).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"aa17\">Leg 2<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"d43f\">We then continued our second leg of our journey south towards Lewisham. Did I mention that the trains are driverless and that passengers get the driver\u2019s view? This has always seemed like a pretty new idea to me, but a little bit of digging into the DLR\u2019s history proved me wrong \u2014 this has been implemented since the start of the DLR system in the 1980s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1X8y5JxshyvZq_YMhR2G5oQ.jpg\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The driverless cabin of a DLR B90 stock<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"3212\">Mud-chute?

I didn\u2019t manage to take photos on the platform because it was quite crowded. I think we would have actually missed this train if it wasn\u2019t delayed, so in this scenario I guess I should be thankful for the National Rail\u2019s inefficiencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"b08d\">Here\u2019s a view of a Northbound Thameslink as we departed London Bridge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1JKq0bbV9GOmzPSJU7_r5Rg.jpg\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Northbound Thameslink train passing above.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"bba2\">And here\u2019s a shot of the crowded Class 455 that took us to Waterloo East.

Unlike other terminals, the entire concourse is slightly curved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1Hn0SaJo3TmjfLtit9Hi15A.jpg\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Interior of Waterloo Station.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"8a7f\">We then boarded our Southwestern train to Clapham Junction, from the old Eurostar Waterloo international terminal.

I believe they aren\u2019t going anywhere soon given that they are still on commuter services like Thameslink, so I guess that means a bit more time to scam clueless rich passengers! Sometimes I wish TfL and national rail can be a bit more transparent when it comes to pricing, but I guess they aren\u2019t really making any net profit anyways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/18KsHcwFLxGTYecV1p8SmUw.jpg\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Southern Class 377 for northbound service.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"da56\">Since we had a bit of time at Watford Junction, we did quite a bit of trainspotting. A few Pedolinos passed by. I really think that the livery looks weird at the moment with the completely white-washed side, but I guess now\u2019s the chance to stare at them before they get repainted with the new Avanti West Coast colours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1QEBHdDUOU2RCrPYiUm9D9w.jpg\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Pedolino, which means \u201cpendulum\u201d in Italian.

We ran through the underpass to take a quick peek at the class 319 train departing for St Albans Abbey. The class 319 used to serve Thameslink, which explains why the train has blue doors, which are unfortunately not very viewable in the photos below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"ec00\">As the train departed, the driver honked, perhaps to give me a wave, or to warn Matthew who was standing a bit too close to the platform edge. Oddly enough, the driver was at the rear end of the train rather than the front end. This doesn\u2019t matter anyways since the train was almost empty and the driver could have walked back to the other end pretty easily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1sbXfdMgi5p76Uxs7T259Bg.jpg\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"264b\">I retouched this photo to emphasise the yellows of the train itself and the tactile paving system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1RXC7own-sMnFW43xuJQdUA.jpg\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Class 319 departing Watford Junction platform 11.

Though not entirely relevant to this train at this location, it was this moment that I realised that all British trains (not underground or DLR trains) have yellow front panels. Turns out this is not a coincidence at all. When the 1950s came by, the industry started using newer diesel and electric trains that were far faster and quieter than their steam counterparts. Consequently, to make trains more visible, the legistration mandates yellow front panels on all trains. A newer standard didn\u2019t come until 2015, which no longer includes this requirement but establishes new requirements for frontlamps. That\u2019s why trains as new as the GWR Class 800s still have a yellow \u201cnose\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1SYBPCx4wk_O4aHRdfDNsEA.jpg\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Tiles at Reagents\u2019s Park Station.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ddbf\">Remaining Leg(s)<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"c5fd\">After arriving at Euston, we took a short walk to Reagent\u2019s Park, where we then took the Bakerloo line trains up north (again) to Harrow and Wealdstone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1PSiVmMG9mtwpUmh4GQn6Hg.jpg\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Northbound Bakerloo line train departing from Reagent\u2019s park.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"9238\">Harrow and Wealdstone is the northern terminus of the Bakerloo line, and it is interesting in that both overground and underground trains here stop at the same platform.

We also have to consider that travelling in a pressurised and densely-packed cabin is risky.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0d25\">I wonder what the options are available if we travel by train instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>London St-Pancras to Paris Gare du Nord; prices start at \u00a329, which is a Eurostar promotion<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Paris Gare de l\u2019Est to Moscow Belorussky; prices start at \u20ac313<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Trans-Manchurian service from Yaroslavsky to Beijing; prices start at \u00a3555<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>High speed train from Beijing West to Hong Kong West Kowloon; prices start at \u00a51077.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"52cc\">In summary, this rounds up to a 9 day trip (assuming you start on a Thursday) that costs a slight bit below \u00a31000. Is this worth it? Maybe. But the thing is the high speed service has already been suspended, so this idea is entirely out of discussion anyways. Plus, travelling on a train isn\u2019t necessarily safer than travelling on a plane, since a train cabin is also slightly pressured duirng high speed and high altitude journeys. This also doesn\u2019t account for the greater risk as you encounter more people during a train journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"138b\">Closing train of thoughts (again)<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"d206\">Perhaps the title of the previous blog \u201cmind the trains\u201d better suits this blog, especially at this very moment, given that it\u2019s really not safe to travel in the underground.
