Perhaps it\u2019s the marvellous sight of the faint grey steam rising from the boiler through the chimney up into the air, or perhaps it\u2019s the puffing and hissing noises of the pumps, or perhaps it\u2019s the intoxicating smell of the smoke\u2026\u2026. despite how that sounds that might actually be true, to a certain extent. Or perhaps it\u2019s Thomas &amp; Friends, and (coincidentally) fun fact, Thomas the tank engine visited the GCR in 2012.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"6c60\">All things aside, steam trains themselves are the embodiment of various technological advancements made in the rail industry in the Industrial Revolution, and in many ways the majestic grandeur of these trains remain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1MefyFMtg0cVHFEeJHnkg8w.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">?\/?<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"f11f\">In March, I was honoured to be (partially) granted a trip to the Great Central Heritage Railway (GCR) that runs from Loughborough Central to Leicester North. This 13km railway is the only mainline heritage railway in the world with such a long distance of working double track, and it hauled what used to be the fastest steam trains in the country. At its (somewhat short-lived) peak, it ran intercity services from the North and East Midlands to the South; understandably, services were halted during the Breeching axe in the 1960s since it\u2019s services were somewhat duplicated by the west coast mainline and midland mainline which transversed similar population centres. Apparently the gauge of the railway is standard European guage since the director of Manchester, Sheffield &amp; Lincolnshire Railway, Sir Edvard Watkin, had very great ambitions for this railway to possibly link this network to France.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"8d20\">We started our journey at the ticket hall of Loughborough Centre Station. Everything at the GCR appears as if it is frozen in the 1930\u201360s, and right away the \u201cstrong wooden smell\u201d of the ticket hall immediately conveys a sense of antiquity. The weird thing thing is that the wooden panels in the ticket hall have been heavily repainted, to the extent that they almost act as mirrors. This degree of glossiness doesn\u2019t fit into black and white, but the pale wooden colour looks out of place as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery alignwide has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1-qMADH5Q6_ae63S_YjeRQQ.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1tikgKgsaVnoFhRKapNrS-A.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"f843\">There\u2019s also a Smith\u2019s on the platform, except it takes the old name \u201cW.H.Smith &amp; Son\u201d.

However, the luggage racks do look a bit narrow for a decently sized suitcase, and in terms of modern day standards, I would imagine them being extended to the isle. Another nice touch is the perfectly aligned windows, which railcar companies seem to ignore today to cram as many passengers as possible into a carriage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"30b2\">There are also more luxurious cabins at the end of the train with more privacy.

This token system of railway signalling is often used on single lines due to the greater risk of collision when the signalman screws up. As a matter of fact, this is also the signalling system used at the Welsh Highlands Heritage Railways. Safety is ensured by having a single physical object available for the single track section, i.e. the token, and ruling that a train may enter the section only if the driver is in possession of the token. In theory the token is locked in a signalling box when not in use, and each token is slightly different to prevent mistakedly using them on adjacent rail section.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery alignwide has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-4 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1niNCNSJh3Go4FIj7U20Uag.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1OW1z6WoGqKcbB5_NCYb4uQ.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"8a77\">Automated electrical signals are the way to go, but good old tokens (that aren\u2019t exactly old) still gets the job done reliably.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1HwWB3IVfy7nmeeN66N9ZlQ.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">BR Class 101 at Leicester North station, which only has a plain undecorated 60\u2019s style canopy.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:1vh\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"7c5e\">British Rail Class 101 Metropolitan Cammell DMUs<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"8f3b\">Subsequently we boarded the British Rail Class 101 Diesel Multiple Unit (DMU). It has a distinct BR line-green livery that very much resembles typical\u7da0\u76ae\u8ecas in China, and similar to many trains in China and Taiwan, there is a \u201cV\u201d in front of the train, which many enthusiasts say is a symbol for \u201cvictory\u201d during wartime. Nonetheless, these DMUs are built in the late 1950s, and are some of the longest-living trains we\u2019ve ever since, the oldest of which retired in 2003 after 47 years of service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"cd4c\">The motor noise of this DMU isn\u2019t very familiar, but I certainly feel right at home when I see this logo!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1EVCG112ra7APS61W3akSUA.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Ahoy there Metro Cammell!<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"c16a\">A view of the interior of this British Rail Class 101, with a 2+3 seating arrangement. The pristine purple moquette of the seat looks luxurious, but not necessarily so with the incoherent orange dividers. That said, they are very comfy compared to modern day tube seats, and even more so when compared to the plastic DLR seats. First class seats on these trains are purple as well, except they have headrests and are placed in a 2+2 configuration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"1414\">The fluorescent light tube at the centre of the ceiling is also absolutely a very 60s look that we can find on carriages of the period, like the one we boarded from Birmingham New Street to Shrewsbury during our winter Wales trip.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1oorEPWCMa-1ku5UhxQ1JXA.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"74d9\">No British Rail, there\u2019s no such thing as fare evasion on a heritage railway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1v0m2pfr4OUypICKNDXXhRg.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"4b86\">I got a view of the driver\u2019s cabin when we approached the southern terminus, Leicester North.

Things immediately look way more fascinating through this ultra-wide glass window. On this particular train, there is a driver on the left and a conductor on the right who is in charge of retrieving and passing tokens to various station masters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"e7e7\">Similarly, a few years back, when you travelled Business (the highest fare class) on a high speed train in China, you got a view of the driver\u2019s cabin and the frontage scenery through a large glass window. Not that I\u2019ve ever had the chance to do so, as a business class ticket is several times more expensive, and anyhow the railway authority later concealed the glass with transcluent material. Maybe they attract rail-nerds like us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery alignwide has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-5 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1k6fQsN3x2g_q4_XYD6QoJg.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1STsT7CpgwbrvdTnOL86PBw.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"ba7e\">Once again, we travelled north back up to Rothley, where there are several shunting locomotives parked in front of the shed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/19oPQfI75gvFuaQKnWHzZew.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Northbound Class 101 approaching Rothley<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"df79\">Another view of the token passing process as we approach the end of the platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1T3EoZ5azz2w4X647ZOSN9w.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Station master about to grab the token from the driver.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"6453\">All set for departure!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1V-COLX5Ct55qau_H5xQ4PQ.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1Yasf6NXq6Dzc8pyjfMLSQA.webp\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">A level crossing leading to the maintenance yard, just a hundred yards or so from the mainline station.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:1vh\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2e09\">Loughborough Traction Maintenance Depot<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"5651\">There maintenance yard at Loughborough is a hundred yards or so north of the mainline station.
