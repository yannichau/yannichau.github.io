So in the first week, I took the opportunity to wander around London as a tourist, with my family. Besides, what better way to fully understand my new camera\u2019s capabilities than to explore a place I\u2019ve (almost) never been too?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"10d1\">In the following blog, I have selected a few of my favourite SOOCs (straight out of camera photos) from London. Being accustomed to editing photos for posts, I absolutely feel liberated when posting SOOCs !<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"b220\"><strong>Wandering around aimlessly (sort of)\u2026\u2026<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"177c\">When you wander around the streets of a new city as a tourist, you start to see the pace of the city and the way people spend their time wandering around. To me the pace of living seems pretty relaxed, but my Swedish and Greek classmates say they have a hard time adapting to such a fast-moving metropolitan lifestyle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"5a76\">Eventually, you really get an idea of how inclusive a community is to foreigners and to photographers. I\u2019ve never been accustomed to the idea of taking photographs of random passerby\u2019s, but these photos demonstrate that many don\u2019t care being photographed at all. Maybe it is to do with the inconspicuous nature of my new LX100, maybe it is to do with the fact that people don\u2019t mind at all. Needless to say, I have definitely captured many unique moments of London\u2019s streets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1bFtP2zNaZfrF4sQWs85CJw.jpg\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">New Oxford Road, near Tottenham Court Road<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"23c0\">By the way, if you see monochrome photos below, I would like to remind you that they are also SOOCs, taken with the L Monochrome D profile on newer Panasonic cameras.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery alignwide has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1Dr_tIqbIzYL2-DOJmq69bg.jpg\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Jaywalker, photo taken at a similar location.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1TehM5yFT43HeJ_ygCNTEyA.jpg\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">A Mini camera Museum!<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"dde6\">I know that taking monochrome photos may seem like something of the past, and taking them on a digital camera may even seem counterintuitive. But in many ways, when it comes to shooting photographs on the street, it seems appropriate to eliminate the excessive plethora of colours from the photo.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"90d7\">For example, this photo would have looked pretty pale in colour, but in monochrome the highlights and shadows definitely pops.  I think monochrome enhances the contrast rendition and brings more attention to the texture of the walls.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1zEpSYcVZSctJHC13IadU2Q.jpg\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Ministry of Justice, Pretty France<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"1c24\">Like Hong Kong, London is a 24\/7 city that never stops moving. But in this seemingly busy city, people find the time and place to enjoy themselves and to entertain everybody else. Perhaps this is the thing that gives London energy and brings people together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/189VXsCDaTe9iuKoCS8uX3A.jpg\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">National Theatre, near River Thame<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"6ef2\">When you\u2019re walking around outerskirts of London, there is a set of entirely different sights.
