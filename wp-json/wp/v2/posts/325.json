Well obviously all these shots were taken on my iPhone, which comprises of a camera I rarely come to appreciate. In fact, several weeks into using the phone did I realise that the second camera on my iPhone is an ultrawide rather than telephoto.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"edf5\">I was slightly bummed as I loved shooting using telephoto on my old iPhone, even though it was technically (and very apparently) an inferior camera compared to its main counterpart. While I wouldn\u2019t say I have an inextinguishable passion in photography, I would say that I have taken lots of photos to have developed an informed opinion; a \u201cnormal\u201d (24\/28\/35mm) lens gives \u201cnormal\u201d but boring perspectives, a \u201ctelephoto\u201d (50\/75mm) tells immersive stories, and an ultrawide lens is a niche accessory that mostly sits in a dustproof box collecting dust.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"828\" height=\"895\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/image-7.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-540\" srcset=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/image-7.png.webp 828w, http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/image-7-278x300.png 278w, http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/image-7-768x830.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>An ultrawide is an extremely valuable tool for architectural photography, and in fact I\u2019ve used my iPhone ultrawide for a couple shots when strolling around the Barbican. However it doesn\u2019t seem to produce photos that fit in to this post, considering that most of the shots up until this point are cropped into squares. A couple of hawk-eyed readers might even start noticing the fisheye distortions and blurry imperfections towards the corners of the photos, which is especially troubling when passerby\u2019s and humans are an important part of the formula when doing street photography.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"828\" height=\"828\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/image-8.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-541\" srcset=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/image-8.png.webp 828w, http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/image-8-300x300.png 300w, http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/image-8-150x150.png 150w, http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/image-8-768x768.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"3739\">Speaking of square photos, there is a certain allure for square photos which makes it an excellent candidate for street photography. I think it is its ability to exhibit confined perspectives and present simple geometries in a pleasing and cohesive manner. For example, with square photos, I find it easier to make the diagonals meet the photo\u2019s corners or to compose with balanced symmetries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"61e9\">That said, I might be a hypocrite anyway, as all these photos were originally shot in 4:3. In my defense, making the best use of the entire sensor always the most sense for post-processing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"828\" height=\"828\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/image-9.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-542\" srcset=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/image-9.png.webp 828w, http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/image-9-300x300.png 300w, http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/image-9-150x150.png 150w, http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/image-9-768x768.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0b8b\">Nevertheless, a square photo\u2019s capability to convey simple geometries is also perhaps its own enemy. In particular, the image can look very unpleasing when parallel lines do not align, or when horizontals and verticals do not align with the photograph borders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"3f9b\">It might not come as a surprise that the colors of these photos have been edited. Afterall, skies on iPhone shots always look a bit too blue, and not every day is a magical day at Disneyland resort. It might however annoy you to learn that many of these photos have been horizontally and vertically warped to make the parallel and perpendicular geometries pleasing to the eye.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"828\" height=\"828\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/image-10.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-543\" srcset=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/image-10.png.webp 828w, http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/image-10-300x300.png 300w, http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/image-10-150x150.png 150w, http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/image-10-768x768.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"8bb7\">And this is why this post is called \u201cShot on iPhone*\u201d with a huge asterisk*.
