Not much going on at the time, but nowhere near bed time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"1e7b\">Fatigued but bored, I collected a pack of crisps and an apple from my bag, as well as my Kindle, and headed up to the attic chill out room. Even if there weren\u2019t anyone in the chill out room, I decided that I could have my evening snack and take a break after my entire night.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"720c\">As I took the last flight of steps, I heard nothing but silence (and my footsteps). From what I\u2019ve learnt in the past two evenings, even the quietest conversations in the room would be slightly audible from the stairwell. I wasn\u2019t too surprised.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"921a\">As I reached the top of the stairs and opened the door to the room, I was immediately greeted by a brief but quickly averting glance from a middle aged man sitting in the couch adjacent to the tea table.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0107\">Alright. I was just here to have my evening snack anyways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"85f7\">So I sat in the couch across him and started chomping my pack of crisps, which, in hindsight, must have been very obnoxious given the silence and the initial averting glances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"2e0e\">Anyways, he was hooded in a plain gray hoodie, wearing a pair of denim jeans and a pair of gray Decathlon sneakers. Nothing too peculiar for a someone his age, in his late forties or fifties I guess. The fact that he was hooded and crossing his arms seemed rather uninviting though. Oddly I was curious enough to break the silence:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"7242\"><em>\u201cYou\u2019re living here in the hostel too?\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"f184\">After a long moment of silence, so long that I was actually about to dig into my pack of crisps again, he murmured,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"cdb3\"><em>\u201cYes. Kind of.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"3cbc\"><em>\u201cHow long are you staying for?\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"c405\"><em>\u201c3 nights.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"95b0\"><em>\u201cAh, me too. But this is gonna be my last night. I arrived on the 27th,\u201d&nbsp;<\/em>which must have triggered minutes of me recounting all the touristy stuff I had been doing in the past few days. Pause,&nbsp;<em>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"8ade\">Another long pause.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"da38\">I do not recall how long that pause took. I might had been having my apple by then, or maybe even back to reading on my Kindle. But as the title suggests, this mysterious man suddenly started telling his story about his homelessness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6ba7\">My preconceived notions of a homeless person?<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"3cb3\"><em>\u201cKicking up the papers<br>With his worn out shoes\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"7400\"><em>\u201cDirt in her hair<br>And her clothes in rags\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"69a0\"><em>\u201cCarrying her home<br>In two carrier bags\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"eac8\">Yes, this is Ralph McTell\u2019s \u201cStreets of London\u201d. And yes, I\u2019m aware that this song describes stories beyond homelessness \u2014 that it is about the lonely, the forgotten, or in general, the alienated. And yes, I\u2019m aware that this is not a story of London.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"63b5\">Let the narrative speak for itself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1b9uCjAhju4wVzYaLv8w59Q.jpg\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"bb6d\">Sainsbury\u2019s<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"e3d8\">Dan, who only revealed his name at the end of the conversation, was staying at the hostel with a subsidy from the local council.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"4552\">18 months ago, he caught two of his six flatmates having cocaine at home. Not wanting to wrestle with all this mess, he decided to mind his own business and ignore this all together. Except he soon realised he couldn\u2019t, because reptitive night shifts at Sainsbury\u2019s meant that he was home whenever his flatmates were drowsing in, and more annoyingly moaning at, whatever shit they got their hands on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"dc42\">Disgruntled, he decided to report this to his landlord, who replied him in an ignorant and insensitive fashion \u2014 his landlord did not even bother to pay a visit or send someone to inspect the state of his flat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"6c19\">Many sleepless nights followed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"8242\">Which meant taking many leaves away from his job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"1a6a\">Meanwhile, his manager remained \u201cvery cold and not very understanding\u201d of his situation, whereas his colleagues distant and treating him \u201cunfairly\u201d and \u201cwith inferiority\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"ba6e\">My recounting of this probably does not do any justice to his hardships. In fact, his recounting probably conveys little about his hardships as well, as it was mostly him ranting on his colleagues passing on all the chores to him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"078e\"><em>\u201cDan, why are you late to work.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"ed33\"><em>\u201cDan, do the tills.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"e70e\"><em>\u201cDan, the three of us are gonna have a break now, reshelf shelf 15.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"830a\">In a nutshell, the disturbances at home, coupled with an \u201cunfriendly working environment\u201d, had affected Dan\u2019s ability to work (or go to work, as a matter of fact). He felt that he should have been acknowledged and compensated for his absences at work, so the fact that his colleagues and managers were not understanding of his situation further annoyed him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"2859\">Anyhow, while he remained a Sainsbury\u2019s employee, he was gradually given less assignments, until several weeks later when he was no longer given any assignments at all. For the uninformed (i.e. me at the time), the assignment amount is proportional to his salary. Hence, he was trapped in a position which prevented him from applying to another job at a new location.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1kxhY3TrZItv6l90pzb76Vw.jpg\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6b18\">More complications<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"743d\"><em>\u201cEvery now and then, this guy comes at my door and pounds on it, loudly yelling my name \u2014 Dan, Dan\u2026\u2026.,\u201d&nbsp;<\/em>he recounted in a slightly trembled voice. It might had been due to the fact that they knew that he reported them to the landlord.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"ceba\">\u201cThe day\u201d came.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"4a19\">Not wanting to tolerate this anymore, he decided to report this to the police. The police came and did a thorough inspection of all the articles in the house. While they did not find anything suspicious in any of the rooms, they found a highly hazardous knife in Dan\u2019s room, behind his bedframe. So he was then taken into interrogation, where he spent hours arguing that he had been falsely accused and that someone in his flat was intentionally framing him into this convoluted situation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"82ee\"><em>\u201cIt was not mine. I have no idea who placed it behind the bedframe. I was starting to suspect whether the cleaning people, who came once fortnightly, were involved in all this,\u201d&nbsp;<\/em>he explained.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"81f4\">That said, he was released and no charges were pressed on him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"d131\">When he returned home however, he found the door to him room broken into \u2014 drawers pulled from their compartments, undergarments spreaded all over the place, curtains teared apart, shattered glass and porcelain pieces from what must have been a violent toss of his mug into the glass window\u2026\u2026..<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"7e33\">Long story short, while the landlord did eventually evict his two drug-addicted flatmates, he never went back to his place anymore.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/1ixx9HrVQmFrxvA5ANyQmiQ.jpg\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5b9c\">More than homeless?<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"8efb\">Because of his dignity he never seeks for help from his father.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"f7f9\">Because he is homeless, he wanders around Bath as well as a couple other towns in Southwest England and Wales, asking for subsidised stays at hostel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"d34b\">Because of his gradually diminishing savings, he has begun selling many of his valuable possessions, like his mobile phone or his car which he used to sleep in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"17c5\">Because of never getting his colleagues and manager to understand him, he never bothered to quit his job and get a new one. So besides seeking for a bed for each night, he spends his days indulging in his grief and preparing for (thinking about) his arbitrations, because he believes he should be compensated for the the work he did not perform as a result of recovering from this trauma.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"f79c\">Which brings us back to his endlessly swirling rants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"745d\">At this point though, I honestly think that this is just him grieving on petty things. Sadly, it\u2019s probably the reason he remains homeless and jobless for two years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"b307\">And now that I look at what I\u2019ve written, I can\u2019t help but notice my apathetic tone. Gulp.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"c8b0\">Fix my iPad<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"6741\">Even though Dan was holding on too his iPad mini this whole time, he does not have a mobile phone, which he had sold a couple months ago. Funnily enough, he asked,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"967c\"><em>\u201cDo you know how to fix my iPad? It doesn\u2019t seem to boot or even light up.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"1ed1\">I actually laughed, though this was awkward because he was not even close to smiling at all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"fae7\"><em>\u201cNo.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"8ba5\">I\u2019m an engineering student, not an engineer. More importantly I\u2019m not a \u201cgenuis\u201d at an Apple Store maintenance bar, which honestly seems like a somewhat mundane occupation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"06fd\">And so he went back into swirling rants about Sainsbury\u2019s failing to understand his needs to this day. That was how the entire night (entire hour) manifested itself, and it was only at the end of the conversation did I get to know his name \u2014 Dan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"01de\">He did not ask for my name.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/yanni-test-local-wp-newdb.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/19eWepqLsRn99mzLEp4KcZQ.jpg\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Taken in London in 2019<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"c956\">A quick note on the photos<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"2874\">All photos (besides the last one) are of artworks at the Victoria Art Gallery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"8960\">I was lucky enough to catch a conversation with Pete, the attendant at the gallery. As a museum attendant he seems to know quite a bit about all the artworks at the museum. When asked about the seemingly arbitrary \u201ctheme\u201d of the artworks at the museum, he simply explained that the artworks are either of stories in the area, or donated from artists in the area. This seems to be true, considering that there is a considerable collection of paints of Bath and its surrounding landscapes.
